## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(readr)
```

```{r}
census <- read_csv("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/EDU01a.csv")
```

```{r}
install.packages("tidyr")
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
census |>
  select(ends_with("D"),Area_name, STCOU)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
census |>
  select(ends_with("D"),Area_name, STCOU) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = "Area_name",
               values_to = "Area_name")
```

```{r}
census |>
  select(ends_with("D"),Area_name, STCOU) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = "Area_name",
               values_to = "Area_name") |>
                 substr("year", 1, 7)
```

```{r}
#grep(pattern = ", \\w\\w", Area_name)
```

```{r}
#class(your_county_tibble) <- c("county", class(your_county_tibble))
```

```{r}
census2 <- read_csv("https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/EDU01b.csv")
```

```{r}
#here is the idea in case it isn't clear
census2 |>
  select(ends_with("D"),Area_name, STCOU) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = "Area_name",
               values_to = "Area_name") |>
                 substr("year", 1, 7)
```

```{r}
#Run these in your console
plot.function #what is used for a class = function
getS3method("plot", census2) #what is used for a class = data frame
```

```{r}
plot
```

```{r}
#plot.state <- function(...){...}
```

```{r}
#plot.state <- function(df, var_name = "_your_default_value_"){
#code to find the means for each division and year (think tidyverse)
#Use get(var_name) to reference the var_name in your call to mean(): mean(get(var_name))
#For this, think group_by along with summarize
#remove the "ERROR" setting
#create a line plot with ggplot with appropriate aes() assignments
}
```

```{r}

```
